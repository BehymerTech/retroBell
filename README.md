# Legal stuff
Copy, share, modify, whatever. If you make a good change, submit a PR so we can all use it. 

I do not own copyrights to anything related to Taco Bell. These themes are unafilliated with Taco Bell and are just fan appreciation. 

If anyone from Taco Bell is listening - I would love some retro merch! Have your people call my people. It's me. I am my people.
